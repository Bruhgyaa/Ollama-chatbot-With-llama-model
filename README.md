It is a chatbot developped using ollama. I used the llama model and integrated with gradio for frontend.

-To run this chatbot you will first need to install ollama from https://ollama.com/
-Once the Installation is done opemn the command terminal and run "Ollama run LLama2"
-It will take few minutes to pull the model and once the model is pulled you can check it by asking few questions in the terminal like "what is internet?" or anythig you'd like to know.
-Once the it runs well in the terminal you can open your python envornment and use pull this code in your env.
-Also install gradio from the terminal by "pip install gradio"
-Once gradio is installed you can run the code and see the result
